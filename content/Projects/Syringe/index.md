We are excited to share one of our recent innovations â€” a realistic 3D model of a medical syringe created using Autodesk Fusion 360.

This project demonstrates our capability to digitally design medical tools for educational and prototyping purposes. The model focuses on:

Realistic proportions

Smooth sliding piston mechanism

Ready for 3D printing if needed

Our goal with such projects is to enhance medical learning through interactive, accurate models.
