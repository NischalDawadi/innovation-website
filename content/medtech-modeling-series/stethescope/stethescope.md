## 🎧 Why We Modeled a Stethoscope

As med students, stethoscopes are extensions of ourselves — we carry them every day. But how often do we actually think about their design?

This model started out of curiosity: could we break down and recreate the form of a stethoscope digitally? Could we make it printable for demo or teaching purposes?

What began as a basic tubing shape turned into a detailed exploration of how each component — from the earpiece to the chest piece — contributes to usability and acoustics.

## 🛠️ Design Highlights

Built entirely in **Fusion 360**, this model includes:
- **Tubing geometry** with soft bends and flexible curves (sweeps & lofts)
- **Chest piece construction** with filleted caps and dynamic head
- **Eartips and stem** modeled as separate bodies for easy modification or printing


> This project challenged us to create **organic curves** and **mechanical details** in the same workflow — something not often taught in tutorials.

## ✨ Key Learnings

- Used **loft and sweep** for soft tubing transitions
- Modeled **complex organic + hard edges** in one design
- Explored **modularity** for physical prototypes (e.g., swappable heads)

## 📐 Applications

We designed this not just to look good, but to:
- Be **3D-printable** as a simulation model
- Use as a **teaching tool** for parts breakdown
- Inspire other students to model their tools in 3D
