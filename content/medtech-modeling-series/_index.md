As medical students with a passion for design and simulation, we challenged ourselves to recreate three essential medical tools using Fusion 360.

This journey wasnâ€™t just about modeling objects â€” it was about understanding the **function behind the form**, and exploring how design translates into usability in the real world.

### ðŸ”§ What We Created


- ðŸ§´ [Part 1 â€“ Medical Bottle: Designing for Usability](https://innovationweb.netlify.app/medtech-modeling-series/medical_bottle/medical_bottle/)
- ðŸ©º [Part 2 â€“ Stethoscope: Anatomy in Design](https://innovationweb.netlify.app/medtech-modeling-series/stethescope/stethescope/)
- ðŸ’‰ [Part 3 â€“ Syringe: Simplicity in Precision](https://innovationweb.netlify.app/medtech-modeling-series/syringe/syringe/)

Each model taught us something unique â€” from tolerances and constraints, to real-world proportions and usability. This project also pushed us deeper into Fusion 360â€™s powerful form and sketch workflows.

> We hope this inspires other students, designers, and tinkerers to explore how 3D modeling can bridge healthcare and innovation.
