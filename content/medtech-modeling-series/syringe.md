## 💭 Why We Modeled a Syringe

Syringes are the most basic yet essential tools in medicine — used daily across every discipline. But behind their simplicity lies thoughtful engineering: the pressure mechanics, the plunger tolerances, the tactile feel.

This model started as an attempt to study those invisible details. How do form and function intersect? How can we simulate them virtually?

Creating this model in Fusion 360 helped us understand the **precision** required even in the most ordinary tools.

## 🛠️ Design Workflow

Key steps involved:
- **Sketch-Based Modeling**: Built the barrel, plunger, and tip using parametric sketches and revolves.
- **Tolerancing**: Added realistic gaps for plunger movement, mimicking actual use.
- **Joint Simulation**: Animated plunger motion to verify usability.
- **Threading & Filleting**: Added fine edges and minor threads for realism and printability.



> We learned how important even 0.2 mm tolerances can be in a medical context.

## 🧠 Key Learnings

- Mastery of **revolve, fillet, shell** operations
- Used **assembly joints** for basic motion simulation
- Considered **3D print feasibility** for educational/simulation models
- Emphasized **parametric control** for iterating on design
