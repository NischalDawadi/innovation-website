## 💭 Why a Medical Bottle?

Every detail of a medical bottle — from the neck thread to the cap grip — is designed with purpose. We wanted to explore that design language ourselves. This project was part of our hands-on dive into medical device modeling using Fusion 360, focused not on complexity, but on **practicality and usability**.

It started as a sketch on paper — just a basic form. But as we built it digitally, we realized how critical things like **volume proportion**, **grip texture**, and **lid-thread alignment** can be.

## 🛠️ Modeling Process

This bottle was modeled in **Fusion 360**, using:

- **Sketch + Revolve**: To create the cylindrical body
- **Thread Tool**: For the screw-cap interface
- **Loft & Fillet**: To add realism to the bottle neck and base
- **Appearance Materials**: To give the render a clean, clinical feel

We tried to balance **printability**, **visual realism**, and **real-world proportions** — based on measurements from actual medicine bottles.

## 🌟 What We Learned

- Mastered threading and rotational symmetry
- Understood how real-world dimensions affect design decisions
- Developed smoother workflows for setting up clean renders

> _“Sometimes the simplest objects teach you the most. Modeling this bottle made us think like engineers and designers, not just students.”_
