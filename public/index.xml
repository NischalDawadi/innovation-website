      <description>As a team exploring 3D modeling in healthcare, we started simple — with a medical bottle. This project taught us how to work with threads, curves, and proportions using Fusion 360. It was our first real step into medical design, and it set the tone for everything that followed.</description>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/medtech-modeling-series/stethescope/</guid>
      <description>We’ve carried stethoscopes as medical students for years — so we decided to build one ourselves. This project was both personal and technical: a Fusion 360 model that helped us learn about organic curves, modular parts, and how everyday tools are designed from the ground up.</description>
